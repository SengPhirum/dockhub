# DockHub

**Run your Docker Swarm from one hub.** A modern, responsive web console for managing Docker Swarm clusters - built in the spirit of Swarmpit, with the operational depth of Portainer and the GitOps convenience of Dokploy.

DockHub gives you live control of nodes, services, stacks, tasks, networks, volumes, secrets, and configs from a single operations hub - with **LDAP authentication**, **role-based access control**, and **GitLab-backed versioning** of every stack's compose file so you can see history and roll back with one click.

Built on **Nuxt 4** + **Nuxt UI 4** + **Tailwind v4**.

---

## Highlights

- **Live swarm control** - nodes (drain/pause/activate, promote/demote, labels, remove), services (scale, redeploy, rolling image updates, logs, delete), tasks, and raw containers.
- **Stacks, versioned in Git** - deploy stacks from compose YAML; every deploy is committed to GitLab first, giving you a full change history and one-click **rollback** to any previous commit.
- **Data resources** - create and manage overlay networks, volumes, secrets (write-only), and configs.
- **Auth & RBAC** - local accounts *and* LDAP login, with three roles: `viewer` (read-only), `operator` (deploy/scale/manage), and `admin` (users, registries, audit).
- **Audit log** - every state-changing action is recorded with actor, target, and detail.
- **Private registries** - store pull credentials for private image registries.
- **Responsive by design** - works from a phone on the server-room floor to an ultrawide on your desk.

## Quick start (development)

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # edit as needed
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:3000
```

DockHub talks to Docker through the socket at `/var/run/docker.sock` by default, so run it **on a swarm manager node** (or point it at a remote engine over TCP - see below). On first run it seeds an admin account:

```text
username: admin
password: admin
```

Override the seed with `NUXT_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `NUXT_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and **change it immediately** in production. Always set a strong `NUXT_JWT_SECRET`.

### Local swarm development

To run DockHub against a local disposable swarm instead of your host Docker engine:

```bash
npm run dev:swarm
```

This uses [`docker-compose.dev.yml`](./docker-compose.dev.yml) to start:

- `swarm-manager` - lightweight Docker-in-Docker container with Node installed, initialized as the swarm manager.
- `swarm-worker-1` - lightweight Docker-in-Docker container joined as a worker.
- `swarm-worker-2` - optional second worker, enabled only for full cluster tests.

DockHub runs inside `swarm-manager` with `npm run dev` and is available at <http://localhost:3000>. Your local project is bind-mounted into `/workspace`, while Linux `node_modules` and `.nuxt` live in named Docker volumes, so file changes on your machine hot reload the app without mixing Windows and Linux dependencies. The compose file reads your local `.env`, then forces `NUXT_DOCKER_SOCKET_PATH=/var/run/docker.sock` so the app controls the manager container's Docker daemon. This dev-swarm path also sets `NUXT_SSR=false` for browser-first hot reload; normal local dev and production builds keep SSR enabled.

By default the local swarm starts only one worker to keep laptops light. Run the full profile when you need manager-plus-two-worker scheduling coverage:

```bash
npm run dev:swarm:full
```

Set `DOCKER_DIND_IMAGE` in `.env` to pin the Docker Engine image used by the disposable swarm, for example `docker:29-dind`.

Useful commands:

```bash
npm run dev:swarm -- ps
npm run dev:swarm -- logs -f swarm-manager
npm run dev:swarm:down
npm run dev:swarm:reset  # removes the disposable swarm volumes
```

This workflow requires Docker Desktop or a Docker Engine that supports privileged containers.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

## Deploy onto the swarm itself

DockHub ships with a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` that runs it as a swarm service, pinned to a manager node. Build and publish the image to the local registry first:

```bash
./release.sh
```

By default this bumps the patch version, writes release notes to `release-notes/v<version>.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, then pushes:

```text
registry.kdsb.com.kh/dockhub:<version>
registry.kdsb.com.kh/dockhub:latest
```

Useful release variants:

```bash
./release.sh --minor
./release.sh --major
./release.sh --version 1.2.0
./release.sh --no-bump          # test publish without changing package version
./release.sh --no-bump --no-push
./release.sh --tag-prefix v     # publish :v1.2.0 instead of :1.2.0
```

Then deploy the published image:

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml dockhub
```

The compose file uses `registry.kdsb.com.kh/dockhub:latest`, mounts the Docker socket read-only, and keeps a named volume for DockHub's own database, with a `node.role == manager` placement constraint.

If your network injects an internal or self-signed root CA, pass that CA into the build so npm can trust it:

```bash
docker build --secret id=npm_ca,src=company-root-ca.crt -t dockhub:latest .
```

On networks that intercept TLS, the Docker build defaults to relaxed npm/Node certificate validation so the image can still be built. If you want to force strict validation during the build, use:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NPM_CONFIG_STRICT_SSL=true --build-arg NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=1 -t registry.kdsb.com.kh/dockhub:latest .
```

Keeping strict validation disabled is convenient on trusted corporate networks, but the CA-secret approach above is the safer long-term option.

## Configuration

Everything is configured through environment variables (full list in [`.env.example`](./.env.example)). The most important ones:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `NUXT_JWT_SECRET` | Signs session cookies - **set a long random value in production**. |
| `NUXT_DOCKER_SOCKET_PATH` | Docker socket path (default `/var/run/docker.sock`). |
| `NUXT_DOCKER_HOST` / `NUXT_DOCKER_PORT` | Use a remote engine over TCP instead of the socket. Add `NUXT_DOCKER_CA` / `CERT` / `KEY` for TLS. |
| `NUXT_ADMIN_USERNAME` / `NUXT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | First-run admin seed. |

### LDAP

Set `NUXT_LDAP_ENABLED=true` and provide your directory details (`NUXT_LDAP_URL`, `BIND_DN`, `BIND_CREDENTIALS`, `SEARCH_BASE`, and an optional `SEARCH_FILTER`, default `(uid={{username}})`). Login then tries LDAP first and falls back to local accounts. Map directory groups to roles with `NUXT_LDAP_ADMIN_GROUP` and `NUXT_LDAP_OPERATOR_GROUP`; everyone else becomes a `viewer`. LDAP users are upserted into the local store on first login so they appear in the Users page.

### OIDC single sign-on

Set `NUXT_OIDC_ENABLED=true` and point DockHub at your provider (`NUXT_OIDC_ISSUER`, `NUXT_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`, `NUXT_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`). DockHub runs the standard authorization-code flow with PKCE and discovers endpoints from `{issuer}/.well-known/openid-configuration`, so it works with Keycloak, Authentik, Entra ID, Okta, Google, and friends. Register `{your-dockhub-url}/api/auth/oidc/callback` as an allowed redirect URI (override with `NUXT_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI` if DockHub sits behind a proxy that rewrites the origin).

Group mapping works like LDAP: the claim named by `NUXT_OIDC_GROUPS_CLAIM` (default `groups`, dot-paths like `realm_access.roles` supported) is matched against `NUXT_OIDC_ADMIN_GROUP` and `NUXT_OIDC_OPERATOR_GROUP`; everyone else becomes a `viewer`. Roles are re-evaluated on every login. The username comes from `NUXT_OIDC_USERNAME_CLAIM` (default `preferred_username`), and OIDC users are upserted into the local store so they appear in the Users page. A "Continue with SSO" button appears on the login page (label via `NUXT_OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME`); local accounts keep working alongside.

### GitLab stack versioning

Provide a GitLab token with **`api`** scope and a target project:

```text
NUXT_GITLAB_TOKEN=glpat-...
NUXT_GITLAB_PROJECT_ID=12345678
NUXT_GITLAB_BRANCH=main          # default
NUXT_GITLAB_STACKS_PATH=stacks   # default
```

Each stack is stored at `stacks/<name>.yml`. Deploying or editing a stack commits the new compose file (so the desired state is recorded even if the deploy fails), and the stack detail page shows the commit timeline with view + rollback. When GitLab isn't configured, stacks still deploy - they just aren't versioned.

## Roles

| Capability | viewer | operator | admin |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| View everything | yes | yes | yes |
| Scale / redeploy / deploy stacks |  | yes | yes |
| Manage nodes, networks, volumes, secrets, configs |  | yes | yes |
| Manage users, registries, view audit log |  |  | yes |

---

## How "stacks" work

Docker Swarm has no native stack API - `docker stack` is a client-side convention built on the `com.docker.stack.namespace` label. DockHub follows the same convention: it parses your compose YAML, ensures declared overlay networks exist, and creates or updates each service (named `<stack>_<service>`) with that label, pruning services you remove. It supports the common compose subset - image, command, environment, `deploy` (replicas/mode/resources/restart_policy/placement/update_config/labels), ports (short and long form), networks, volumes/mounts, and healthcheck - and surfaces a warning rather than failing on directives it doesn't translate.

## What's implemented vs. roadmap

This is a real, runnable foundation that implements the core of every area above against the live Docker Engine API. In the interest of honesty:

**Implemented:** live read + control for nodes/services/stacks/tasks/networks/volumes/secrets/configs/containers; local + LDAP auth with JWT/RBAC; GitLab commit history and rollback; audit logging; private registry storage; service log viewing (tail); responsive UI throughout.

**Natural next steps (roadmap):** streaming/live-follow logs over WebSockets, per-task CPU/memory metrics and charts, container exec/terminal, compose validation with a richer translator, multi-cluster endpoints, webhook-driven GitOps redeploys, and 2FA. The architecture leaves clean seams for each.

// knetrahub-agent (formerly knetrahub-agent) dispatcher. Deployed as a
// `deploy: mode: global` swarm service so one task runs on every node.
//
// KNETRAHUB_AGENT_MODE (comma-separated: docker,server,network,asset)
// selects which collector(s) this task runs. Defaults to "docker" alone -
// existing deployments that don't set this var at all keep behaving exactly
// as before (KNETRAHUB_AGENT_MODE is accepted too, as an alias, for the same
// reason). Each collector owns its own report loop/interval/target endpoint;
// this file only decides which collectors to start.
